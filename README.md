# Handball Action Recognition and Highlight Generation

This repository contains the core code and resources for a handball action recognition system, designed as part of a Final Year Project. The system performs detection, tracking, action classification, and highlight generation based on player actions, particularly in jump shot motion, in match/training footage.
